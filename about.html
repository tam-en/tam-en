Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Anyone can paint. Just relax and let it flow. </p><p>That easy. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. </p><p>It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. This is unplanned it really just happens. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Everybody's different. </p><p>And maybe a little bush lives there.It all happens automatically. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.

				<h2 id="leftelbow">Leftelbow? But . . . <em>why?</em></h2>
				<p>People occasionally ask why my personal media empire is named, of all things, *leftelbow.com*. Here’s the story.</p>
				<p>It was late one night in the early 2000s, and I was staring with increasing exhaustion at the pallid glow of my iMac CRT. I was trying to register a domain name, but time was running out—our newborn son had a strict policy of not sleeping more than two hours at a time.</p>
				<p>Twice in the last year, we‘d had ISPs suddenly go belly up, leaving us scrambling to send change-of-address notifications. I was determined to get us our own domain names so we wouldn’t wind up shipwrecked again. For mine, I wanted something easy to spell and remember, which, sadly, ruled out all derivations of my name. I’d spent several days brainstorming solutions.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, the registration process wasn’t going well. All of my best ideas—even the runners-up—were already taken, and I found myself improvising while sleep-deprived and increasingly punchy.</p>
				<p>At one point I found myself typing *leftelbow.com* into the registry engine, and—*what?!*—it was actually available! *Leftelbow.com* was easy to spell, and it wouldn’t pigeonhole me professionally. And, compared to the other ideas blundering from my head like revelers leaving a bar at closing time, *leftelbow.com* had a certain unassuming dignity, even charm. I paid for the domain and have had it ever since. </p>
