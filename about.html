				<h2 id="work">Work background</h2>
				<p><span class="run-in">HI THERE.</span> I&rsquo;m a full-stack web developer and writer/editor with extensive experience in editorial management, electronic publishing and design (esp. Adobe Creative Suite), technical writing/editing, database publishing, and more. I worked at Adobe Systems for ten years, mostly as a technical editor; my last job there was as the chief editor of <em>Adobe Magazine</em>. I’m currently a consultant.</p>
				<p>Nitty-gritty on my professional background can be found via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamis-nordling/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> or by downloading my <a href="#">résumé pdf</a>. Please contact me if I can help with your next web development, editorial, design, or technology project. </p><br>

				<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
				<p>This web site was prepared entirely with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I may do some refactoring with fancier tools at some point, but it has been fun putting this together using just the essentials. </p>
				<p>Although the CSS is structured with desktop styling first, mobile second, the mobile experience was primary when I did the wireframing of the index page elements and grid in Adobe InDesign.</p>
				<p>This site makes heavy use of CSS grid, with the grid and positioning of elements changing with three mobile queries. I used Javascript to create listeners for various elements on the index page so that they would respond as groups to mouseovers, mouseouts, and clicks. Javascript is also used to create a sticky scroll on the secondary menu of the &ldquo;about&rdquo; page

				<h2 id="leftelbow">Leftelbow? But . . . <em>why?</em></h2>
				<p>People occasionally ask why my personal media empire is named, of all things, <em>leftelbow.com</em>. Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>
				<p>It was late one night in the early 2000s, and I was staring with increasing exhaustion at the wan glow of my iMac CRT. I was trying to register a domain name, but time was running out. Our newborn son had a strict policy of not sleeping more than two hours at a time, and it had been more than an hour already.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, the registration process wasn&rsquo;t going well. I wanted a domain name that was easy to spell and remember, which, sadly, ruled out all derivations of the name my parents had given me.  I&rsquo;d spent several days brainstorming solutions, but all of my best ideas&mdash;even the runners-up&mdash;were already taken, and I found myself improvising while sleep-deprived and increasingly punchy, a state that renders me dangeously amused by my own thoughts.</p>
				<p>At one point I found myself typing <em>leftelbow.com</em> into the registry engine, and&mdash;<em>what?!</em>&mdash;it was actually available! <em>Leftelbow.com</em> was easy to spell, and it wouldn&rsquo;t pigeonhole me professionally. And, compared to the other ideas blundering from my head like revelers leaving a bar at closing time, <em>leftelbow.com</em> was strikingly dignified. I paid for the domain and have had it ever since. </p>
				<p>The end.</p>
