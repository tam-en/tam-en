				<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
				<p>This web site, a work in progress, has been prepared entirely with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I may do some refactoring with fancier tools at some point, but it has been fun putting this together using just the essentials. </p>
				<p>The mobile experience was primary when I did the wireframing of the index page elements and grid in Adobe InDesign.</p>
				<p>This site makes heavy use of CSS grid, with the grid and positioning of elements changing with three media queries. I used Javascript to create listeners for various elements on the index page so that they would respond as groups to mouseovers, mouseouts, and clicks. Javascript is also used to create a sticky scroll on the secondary menu of this particular page as well as the made-from-scratch hamburger menu on the mobile version of this site.</p>
				<p>The body copy is set in Lato with a 1.5em line height. Headers are in Fira Sans or Fira Sans Condensed. Social media icons are from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>.</p>
				<p>The images at the top of each page are of my own doing&mdash;bits and pieces from various projects, including colored pencils, pen & ink, duct tape, and even the chocolates (heavy cream, chocolate, etc., also from scratch)!</p>
				<br><br>

				<h2 id="leftelbow">Leftelbow? But . . . <em>why?</em></h2>
				<p>People occasionally ask why my personal media empire is named <em>leftelbow.com</em>. Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>
				<p>It was late one night in the early 2000s, and my tired eyes were having trouble staying focused in the anemic glow of my iMac CRT. We&rsquo;d had two ISPs suddenly go belly up in the last year, leaving us with no e-mail addresses, and I wasn&rsquo;t having that again. So I was trying to register my own domain name.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, time was running out. Our newborn son had a strict policy of not sleeping more than two hours at a time, and we were nearing the 1.5 hour mark. The registration process wasn&rsquo;t going well. I wanted a domain that was easy to spell and remember, and that, sadly, ruled out all derivations of my own name. I&rsquo;d spent several days brainstorming, but all of my best ideas&mdash;even the mediocre runners-up&mdash;were already taken. And so I found myself improvising while sleep-deprived and increasingly punchy, a state that renders me dangeously prone to think myself witty.</p>
				<p>At one point I found myself typing <em>leftelbow.com</em> into the registry engine, and&mdash;<em>what?!</em>&mdash;it was actually available! <em>Leftelbow.com</em> was easy to spell. Sure, it was a bit offbeat and brand-oblivious, but I told myself it wouldn&rsquo;t pigeonhole me professionally. Besides, compared to the other ideas blundering from my head like revelers leaving a bar at closing time, <em>leftelbow.com</em> seemed downright sober. I paid for the domain and have had it ever since. </p>
				<p>The end.</p>
