				<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
				<p>This web site, a work in progress, has been prepared entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I may do some refactoring with fancier tools at some point, but it&rsquo;s been fun putting this together using the basics. </p>
				<p>The mobile experience was primary when I did the wireframing of the index page elements and grid in Adobe InDesign.</p>
				<p>This site makes heavy use of CSS grid and flexbox. The grid and positioning of elements changes with three media queries. I used JavaScript to create listeners for various elements on the index page so that they would respond as groups to mouseovers, mouseouts, and clicks. JavaScript also powers the sticky scroll on page-specific menus as well as the made-from-scratch hamburger menu for mobile & viewports less than 950px.</p>
				<p>The body copy is set in Lato with a 1.5em line height. Headers are in Fira Sans or Fira Sans Condensed. Social media icons are from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>.</p>
				<p>The images at the top of each page are of my own non-digital creation&mdash;bits and pieces from various projects, including colored pencils, pen & ink, duct tape, and, yes, even the chocolates (heavy cream, chocolate, etc.). I like to remember that real life isn&rsquo;t powered by ones and zeros.</p>
				<br>

				<h2 id="leftelbow">Leftelbow?</h2>
				<p>People occasionally ask why my personal media empire is named <em>leftelbow.com</em>. Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>
				<p>It was late one night in the early 2000s, and my tired eyes were having trouble staying focused in the anemic glow of my iMac CRT. We&rsquo;d had two ISPs suddenly go belly up in the last year, leaving us with no e-mail addresses. I wasn&rsquo;t having that again, which is why I was trying to register my own domain name.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, time was running out. Our newborn son had a strict policy of not sleeping more than two hours at a time, and we were nearing the 1.5 hour mark. Meanwhile, the registration process wasn&rsquo;t going well. I wanted a domain that was easy to spell and remember, and that, sadly, ruled out all derivations of my own name. I&rsquo;d spent several days brainstorming, but all of my best ideas&mdash;even the mediocre runners-up&mdash;were already taken. And so I found myself improvising while sleep-deprived and increasingly punchy, a state that renders me dangeously amused by my own wit.</p>
				<p>At one point I found myself typing <em>leftelbow.com</em> into the registry engine, and&mdash;<em>what?!</em>&mdash;it was actually available! Sure, <em>leftelbow.com</em> was a little offbeat, but I told myself it was easy to spell and wouldn&rsquo;t pigeonhole me professionally. Besides, it was so much better than <em>satanicwombat.com</em> and some of the other ideas blundering from my head like revelers leaving a bar at closing time. I paid for the domain and have had it ever since. </p>
				<p>The end.</p>
