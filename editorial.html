				<p>## TECHNICAL WRITING/EDITING

##### *Aldus* and *Adobe Magazine*

For six years I was an editor at *Adobe Magazine* (née *Aldus Magazine),* an advertising- and subscription-supported trade publication on electronic publishing, design, and digital media that had, at its zenith, an international circulation of ~1.2 million (including an audited ~800,000 in the U.S.). I was the technical editor, then managing editor, and finally chief editor.

Editorial matter included technical Q&As, how-to articles, and feature stories on design and publishing topics. Below is a partial list of articles that I wrote or co-wrote (unless otherwise noted, I was the sole bylined author). Adobe no longer maintains an online archive of this material, and I have vector PDFs only for the articles published in 1995 and 1996, which are available via the text links below.

“The ABCs of UAEs.” *Aldus Magazine*, vol. 3, no. 2, January/February 1992, 51–55. Methods for preventing and troubleshooting the dreaded Unrecoverable Application Error.

“It Just Takes Two.” *Aldus Magazine*, vol. 6, no. 1, November 1994, 42–47. Guidelines for working with two-color publications, with specific tips for PageMaker and Aldus FreeHand.

“Masterful Font Juggling.” *Aldus Magazine*, vol. 6, no. 4, March/April 1995, 30. Review of Master Juggler v. 1.9, font-management software.

“Shopping on the Left Side of the Brain.” *Aldus Magazine*, vol. 6, no. 6, July/August 1995, 27–32. *Aldus Magazine* goes shopping for a Pentium-based PC with the intent of creating a dedicated Photoshop workstation.

“Have Your Cake and Eat It, Too.” *Adobe Magazine*, vol. 7, no. 3, January/February 1996, 55–59. Advice for creating PDF files that are attractive, readable, and compact.

“A Frame Job?” *Adobe Magazine*, vol. 7, no. 8, September/October 1996, 19. Frames vs. free-form layout in PageMaker 6.5. 

“Packing Light,” by Teri Patrick and Tamis Nordling. *Adobe Magazine*, vol. 9, no. 1, Winter 1998, 41–43. How fully embedding, or subsetting, or not embedding fonts in PDF files affects file size, editability, and typographic fidelity.

“Food for Thought,” by John D. Berry and Tamis Nordling. *Adobe Magazine*, vol. 9, no. 2, Spring 1998, 30–35. Feature article on the challenges and lessons of cookbook design.

“Moonlighting with PageMaker,” by Wendy Katz and Tamis Nordling. *Adobe Magazine*, vol. 9, no. 4, Autumn 1998, 43–46. Tricks for using PageMaker to handle jobs normally associated with enterprise software, including mail merge, labels, and more.

##### *Aldus TechNotes*

In 1992 I was hired to convert *Aldus TechNotes*, which had been a series of infrequently published books, to a bimonthly periodical covering Aldus FreeHand, PageMaker, Photostyler, and Persuasion. I worked with other departments to design the product; research, write, lay out, and produce each issue; manage inventory and distribution; and set pricing structures and other policies. *Aldus TechNotes* (circulation ~10,000) covered undocumented features, troubleshooting tips, and advanced techniques. Each issue included two 16-page, platform-specific editions (Mac and PC). You can read a sample issue by clicking here or on the thumbnail—if you‘ve been itching to read about PPD editing techniques circa 1994, this is your lucky day!</p>
