				<h2>TECHNICAL WRITING/EDITING</h2><br>
				<h3><em>Aldus</em> and <em>Adobe</em> Magazine</h3>
				<p>For six years I was an editor at <em>Adobe Magazine</em> (née <em>Aldus Magazine</em>), an advertising- and subscription-supported trade publication on electronic publishing, design, and digital media that had, at its zenith, an international circulation of ~1.2 million (including an audited ~800,000 in the U.S.). I was the technical editor, then managing editor, and chief editor.</p>
				<p>Editorial matter included technical Q&As, how-to articles, and feature stories on design and publishing topics. Below is a partial list of articles that I wrote or co-wrote (unless otherwise noted, I was the sole bylined author). Adobe no longer maintains an online archive of this material, and I have vector PDFs only for the articles published in 1995 and 1996, which are available via the text links below.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>&ldquo;The ABCs of UAEs.&rdquo; <em>Aldus Magazine</em>, vol. 3, no. 2, January/February 1992, 51–55. Methods for preventing and troubleshooting the dreaded Unrecoverable Application Error.</li>

					<li>&ldquo;It Just Takes Two.&rdquo; <em>Aldus Magazine</em>, vol. 6, no. 1, November 1994, 42–47. Guidelines for working with two-color publications, with specific tips for PageMaker and Aldus FreeHand.</li>

					<li>&ldquo;Masterful Font Juggling.&rdquo; <em>Aldus Magazine</em>, vol. 6, no. 4, March/April 1995, 30. Review of Master Juggler v. 1.9, font-management software.</li>

					<li>&ldquo;Shopping on the Left Side of the Brain.&rdquo; <em>Aldus Magazine</em>, vol. 6, no. 6, July/August 1995, 27–32. <em>Aldus Magazine</em> goes shopping for a Pentium-based PC with the intent of creating a dedicated Photoshop workstation.</li>

					<li>&ldquo;Have Your Cake and Eat It, Too.&rdquo; <em>Adobe Magazine</em>, vol. 7, no. 3, January/February 1996, 55–59. Advice for creating PDF files that are attractive, readable, and compact.</li>

					<li>&ldquo;A Frame Job?&rdquo; <em>Adobe Magazine</em>, vol. 7, no. 8, September/October 1996, 19. Frames vs. free-form layout in PageMaker 6.5.</li>

					<li>&ldquo;Moonlighting with PageMaker,&rdquo; by Wendy Katz and Tamis Nordling. <em>Adobe Magazine</em>, vol. 9, no. 4, Autumn 1998, 43–46. Tricks for using PageMaker to handle jobs normally associated with enterprise software, including mail merge, labels, and more.</li>
					</ul><br>

				<h3><em>Aldus TechNotes</em></h3>

				<p>In 1992 I was hired to convert <em>Aldus TechNotes</em>, which had been a series of infrequently published books, to a bimonthly periodical covering Aldus FreeHand, PageMaker, Photostyler, and Persuasion. I worked with other departments to design the product; research, write, lay out, and produce each issue; manage inventory and distribution; and set pricing structures and other policies. *Aldus TechNotes* (circulation ~10,000) covered undocumented features, troubleshooting tips, and advanced techniques. Each issue included two 16-page, platform-specific editions (Mac and PC). You can read a sample issue by clicking here or on the thumbnail—if you‘ve been itching to read about PPD editing techniques circa 1994, this is your lucky day!</p><br><br><br><br>
