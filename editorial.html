						<p>For six years I was an editor at <em>Adobe Magazine</em> (n&eacute;e <em>Aldus Magazine</em>), an advertising- and subscription-supported trade publication on electronic publishing, design, and digital media that had, at its zenith, an international circulation of ~1.2 million (including an audited ~800,000 in the U.S.). I was the technical editor, managing editor, and then chief editor.</p>
						<p>Editorial matter included technical Q&As, how-to articles, and feature stories on design and publishing topics. Below is a partial list of articles that I wrote or co-wrote (unless otherwise noted, I was the sole bylined author).</p>

				<h3 id="technotes"><em>Aldus TechNotes</em></h3>
				<div class="text-wrap-gallery-reverse">
					<p>In 1992 I was hired to convert <em>Aldus TechNotes</em>, which had been a series of infrequently published books, to a bimonthly periodical covering Aldus FreeHand, PageMaker, Photostyler, and Persuasion. I worked with other departments to design the product; research, write, lay out, and produce each issue; manage inventory and distribution; and set pricing structures and other policies. <em>Aldus TechNotes</em> (circulation ~10,000) covered undocumented features, troubleshooting tips, and advanced techniques. Each issue included two 16-page, platform-specific editions (Mac and PC). Click on the thumbnail to see a sample issue.</p>
